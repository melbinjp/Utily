# WeCanUseAI.com - AI Tools Portal

This repository contains the source code for WeCanUseAI.com, a portal showcasing a collection of AI-powered web tools and utilities. The project is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application with a focus on performance, accessibility, and a clean, maintainable structure.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Performance-Optimized**: Built to be fast, with a focus on achieving high Lighthouse scores.
- **Accessibility-First**: Designed to be usable by everyone, with a perfect Lighthouse accessibility score.
- **Modular JavaScript**: Code is split into modules for better maintainability and lazy loading.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A clean, responsive design with a featured tool carousel and a filterable grid of applications.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports a dark color scheme.
- **PWA Ready**: Includes a service worker and manifest for Progressive Web App capabilities.

## Lighthouse Scores

The following scores were achieved after the latest optimizations:

### Mobile

- **Performance**: 74
- **Accessibility**: 100
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 98

### Desktop

- **Performance**: 80
- **Accessibility**: 100
- **Best Practices**: 100
- **SEO**: 98

_Note: The performance score is heavily impacted by the lack of server-side compression and caching in the development environment. With a properly configured server, this score should be significantly higher._

## ðŸ”§ Development & Build Process

This project uses `npm` for dependency management and running build scripts.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wecanuseai.com.git
    cd wecanuseai.com
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Build Scripts

- **`npm run build`**: Creates a production-ready build in the `dist/` directory. This script performs the following tasks:
  - Optimizes and purges unused CSS with `postcss` and `cssnano`.
  - Minifies JavaScript with `terser`.
  - Copies all necessary files (`index.html`, `tools.json`, etc.) to the `dist/` directory.

- **`npm run build:css`**: Runs only the CSS optimization task.
- **`npm run build:js`**: Runs only the JavaScript minification task.

### Local Development

- **`npm run preview`**: Starts a local development server using `http-server` to serve the `dist/` directory. This is useful for testing the production build locally.

### Performance Testing

- **`npm run lighthouse:mobile`**: Runs Lighthouse on the local development server with mobile emulation.
- **`npm run lighthouse:desktop`**: Runs Lighthouse on the local development server with desktop emulation.

_Before running the Lighthouse tests, make sure you have the local server running with `npm run preview`._

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The `dist/` directory contains the complete, optimized static site. You can deploy this directory to any static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

For optimal performance, ensure your hosting provider enables the following:

- **HTTP/2**: For faster resource loading.
- **Gzip/Brotli Compression**: To reduce the size of text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON).
- **Cache-Control Headers**: To leverage browser caching for static assets.

A GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages is included in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
